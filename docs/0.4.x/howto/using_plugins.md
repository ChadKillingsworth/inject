Inject's plugin support allows you to transform and manipulate assets that may not be JavaScript by default. By converting them to JavaScript, you can use these assets just like any other `require` resource. This page talks about how to use the three default plugins that ship with Inject. Feel free to add your own plugins by following the example. Eventually, we expect to have a library of plugins for all.

If you're interested in using a plugin popularized by the AMD Specification, please read the [how-to for AMD](/docs/0.4.x/howto/amd.html).
