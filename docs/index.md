Inject documentation is broken up into two main sections: **API** and **How To**. The **API** section details how the public functions for Inject work (as well as the CommonJS and AMD `require()` and `define()` functions), while the **How To** provides useful working tutorials on a range of topics.

If you're looking to get started from scratch, the **Quick Start Guide** will get you going.

Enjoy!
