##Overview
Inject 0.7.0 is a continuation of our project simplification, and comes with significant changes around the configuration APIs.

## Backwards Compatibility Concerns
The following API methods were removed or replaced:

* Inject.clearCache has been replaced with simply calling [Inject.reset](/docs/0.7.x/api/inject.reset.html)
* Inject.disableGlobalAMD has been simplified to [Inject.disableAMD](/docs/0.7.x/api/inject.disableamd.html)
* Inject.enableDebug was replaced with a clear debugging method, [Inject.enableSourceUrls](/docs/0.7.x/api/inject.enablesourceurls.html)
* Inject.setUseSuffix was replaced with [Inject.enableSuffixes](/docs/0.7.x/api/inject.enableSuffixes.html)

## New Features
* Create Context: If you need a second copy of Inject, you can call Inject.createContext(). This will return a new Inject instance that can have its own module root, own rules, and own AMD settings. Details on this API can be found at the [Inject.createContext API page](/docs/0.7.x/api/inject.createcontext.html).

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue where define() might pick up an array immediately following the opening factory function
* Improved stacktrace-js integration
* Cleaned up iframe code which was not getting an absolute position
* Can now call define() without a base URL set via Inject.setModuleRoot
