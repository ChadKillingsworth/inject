{% highlight js %}
Inject.addRule(/regexMatch/?, weight?, { /* options */ });

Inject.addRule(/regexMatch/?, { /* options */ });
Inject.addRule('string'?, { /* options */ });

This is now a **DEPRECATED** call.

Please use one of the following methods:

* [Inject.addModuleRule](/docs/0.5.0/api/inject.addmodulerule.html) to replace path based rules where the intent was just to change the module's resolved ID.
* [Inject.addFileRule](/docs/0.5.0/api/inject.addfilerule.html) to replace path based rules where the intent was to change the final URL used for the module ID.
* [Inject.addFetchRule](/docs/0.5.0/api/inject.addfetchrule.html) a new rule, used to change the fetching mechanism used for a resolved Module ID. (previously, this was internalized in plugins, but has been made directly available)
* [Inject.addContentRule](/docs/0.5.0/api/inject.addcontentrule.html) to replace the afterFetch pointcut
* [Inject.addPackage](/docs/0.5.0/api/inject.addpackage.html) to create global aliases for a module while still maintaining its original resolved location
