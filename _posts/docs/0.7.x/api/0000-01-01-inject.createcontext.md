If you need to manage multiple instances of Inject, such as scenarios where you would want to manage multiple base URLs, `Inject.createContext` allows you to create a standalone instance of Inject. This new version can receive a completely different set of rules, module root, and any other Inject configuration setting.

By default, all Inject instances will share the same URL cache, but this can be overriden by setting a new localstorage key via [Inject.setCacheKey()](/docs/0.7.x/api/inject.setCacheKey.html).
