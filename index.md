# A New Kind of Module Loader
**Inject is the link that brings CommonJS to the Browser.** Inject is a fast and lightweight library that removes the pain of dependencies in the browser. If you've written modules for [node.js](http://nodejs.org), then you're equipped to write code for the browser using Inject. **Our mission is to make managing JavaScript dependencies painless.**

* CommonJS **and** AMD Compliant
* Works with CDNs and cross-domain requests out of the Box
* Supports localStorage when available

# Getting Fancy
Advanced topics such as loading from CDNs (Cross-Domain support), use AMD functionality, importing your favorite non-CommonJS library, and more can all be found in the [Documentation](/docs/).
